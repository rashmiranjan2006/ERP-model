Most colleges run critical daily operations (timetable, mess, events, rooms, clubs, attendance, complaints) using a mix of WhatsApp, Excel, notice boards, and manual approvals.

That causes:
Timetable conflicts: room clashes, faculty overlaps, last-minute substitutions, poor slot utilization.
Mess mismanagement: overproduction (waste) or shortages, unclear token/attendance prediction, slow complaint resolution.
Fragmented information: students check 5 different places for updates, leading to missed classes/events and confusion.
No data-driven planning: decisions are reactive rather than predictive (no demand forecasting, no crowd prediction, no optimization).
Low accountability: hard to track who approved what, when changes happened, and how complaints were handled.

A single web platform that manages all college activities end-to-end with ML built into the most chaotic parts:
Core ML focus areas
Smart Timetable Engine
Generates/updates schedules automatically while respecting constraints (faculty availability, room capacity, lab requirements, batch divisions, elective clashes).
Suggests best alternatives during disruptions (faculty leave, room unavailable).
Mess Demand Prediction + Menu Optimization
Predicts how many students will eat each meal (breakfast/lunch/dinner).
Helps plan quantity, reduce waste, and improve satisfaction by learning from feedback.
This becomes a 360° system because timetable + mess connect to attendance patterns, hostel occupancy, events, exams, and holidays.
